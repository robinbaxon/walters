`web\walters.html` is the first web implementation of the Walters Mandler recipe generator.
It has existed since march 2017.
The web version spawned as a result of the original ClickOnce WinForms app not being very distributable anymore.

An expressed goal is to populate the `winforms` dir with the old WinForms source code, should it be located i the future.
